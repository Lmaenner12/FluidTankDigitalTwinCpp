# Fluid Tank Digital Twin
This is a C++ programm that simulates the connection of 4 fluid tanks using ImGui and ImPlot for rendering.

**Goal**: Create a digital Twin, which simulates different controll states of the tanks and delivers optimal Parameters for a real controller of the tanks.

The Tanks are connected via pumps and sensors are measuring the height of the fluid (Fluidlevel). The connection of the tanks looks as follows:

## Prerequisites

- CMake
- Qt
- C++20 or higher
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
  
## Controlls:
As of right now, the tanks have fixed initial values. You can press start or stop the pumps and a button to refill tank 1 or 2. The plots show the fluidlevel measured by the sensor of the respektive tanks.

## To DoÂ´s
- Refactoring of the Code
- Implement controll states
- Fix the GUI, so that the Windows are located at fixed places and are not movable
- Create GUI for initial values of the tanks and pumps (e.g. power, volumestream)
- Enable a live connection to a real sensor
